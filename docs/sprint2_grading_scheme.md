# Project Part 3/Sprint 2 Evaluation credit, CS2005 W2024

## Team submission

Team submission evaluation will be based on the following:

* The README file in your repo will be read by the marker to run the program, unit tests, and find out what other documentation the evaluator should read. It is your responsibility to tell the marker how to find the evaluation components, it is not the marker's responsibility to hunt through the documents and code to find those items.
  * The content of the Kanban Board, issue tracker, and repo will be reviewed
  * Other documents should be put in a documents folder in your repo and indicated in README file, if they should be read for marking assessment
  * If you are using other github tools that need to be reviewed (e.g. discussion or wiki tools) make sure this is made clear to the evaluator in the repo README file.

* Evaluation components will include:
  * Properly minuted SCRUM meetings and decisions (20%)
    * This will be weighted by the number of properly conducted meetings held on regular basis and quickly available in the repo.
    * **5 points** agenda coverage for each meeting includes progress review with kanban and issue tracker
    * **4 points** decisions documented properly with response plan and reflected in the Kanban Board/issue tracker
    * **3 points** changes to architecture and low level designs (interfaces) discussed, determined, and documented. Architecture documents adjusted accordingly.
    * **2 points** SCRUM master and notetaker roles rotated among team
    * **3 points** Minutes committed and pushed regularly, so team members can access.
    * **3 points** Reasonable distribution of tasks among team. Design interface/services and Coding tasks assigned to individual team members. Tasks on KanBan board.
  * Maintenance of the Kanban Board and the issue tracker in your project repository (15%)
    * Kanban board must be set up early in the first sprint. 
    * **2 points** Consistent continuous use. Assignment, labels, color coding, categories, etc. used appropriately and consistently by team. 
    * **5 points** Create cards for backlog features, required functionality for sprint 2, and assigned tasks.
    * **3 points** Progress of tasks/issues noted on board and tracker
    * **5 points** New issues (tasks) arising in meetings, reviews and otherwise are noted on issue tracker (board)
  * New performance reviews for sprint II (how did the team members perform) conducted and documented (5%)
    * **5 points** Each team member assessed, by each other team member. Serious performance reviews including problems/personality clashes and possible solutions. A trivial review indicating everyone did fine will be assumed to be pro-forma and will be given no credibility. Problems with the team progress, dynamics and process must be identified and documented, and tracked with possible responses and progress on those items becoming kanban/agenda items. If you have no issues with a particular team member, you can at least make a suggestion for their project activity.
  * Code reviews conducted and documented. (20%)
    * Code should be regularly presented and discussed as a team, not just at end of cycle.
    * **5 points** Code review details incorporated into process model and pull requests.
    * **10 points** Code reviews are thorough, including style issues. 
    * **3 points** All code should be reviewed by entire team before pull request is merged.
    * **2 points** Pull request deadlines for code contributions established and enforced.
  * User stories (10%)
    * **5 points** Stories offer comprehensive description of a imagined interaction with the system (either as working as imagined) with sufficient detail to implicate design suggesitons.
    * **5 points** One story and one feature suggestion per member. Story should suggest a new feature that is not obvious, so that user stoiry has contributed to the backlog of ideas.  
  * Component Architecture Documents (5 %)
    * These should be updated as your project design matures during the sprint
      * **5 points** Details of components and interfaces documented correctly
  * docGameFrame Framework proposal document (15%)
    * **5 points** Document(s) shows refactoring of module as needed with interface changes and arch diagrams as needed to illustate changes.
    * **5 points** Redesign comparison to existing arch is illustrated with overall and module diagrams that use consist format.
    * **5 points** How to use framework is clear from description and shows understanding of decoupling issues involved with each project module.  
  * Process Model Document (5 %)
    * **5 points** Elements of process identified and explained. Distinction made between process and process model.
  * Sprint (end) release status (5%)
    * **5 points** operation of software and available features clear from documents and video/user manual

**100 points** total
