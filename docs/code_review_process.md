# Code Review Process

## Initial Steps Before Code Review
- **To-Do Creation**: For each task, a to-do is created with specific assignees and labels attached to each to-do to categorize and prioritize the work effectively.
- **Issue Conversion**: Each to-do is then converted into an issue and placed in the appropriate section of the Kanban board, such as "In Progress", "Backlog", etc., to visually track the progress of tasks.
- **Branch Creation**: Team members create a new branch for each issue to maintain an organized workflow and ensure that work on different features or fixes does not interfere with the main codebase. This branch serves as the dedicated development environment for the task at hand.

## 1. Pre-Review Preparation
- **Task Creation**: Assign a task for code review in the sprint to ensure it's accounted for in the workload.
- **Documentation**: Every piece of code that needs to be reviewed should have corresponding documentation (e.g., comments, commit messages) that explains the changes and their purpose.

## 2. Submission for Review
- **Pull Requests (PR)**: Developers submit their code for review using pull requests on the version control platform.
- **Description**: PRs should include a thorough description of changes, linking to the task or user story they relate to.

## 3. Team Review
- **Checklist**: Team Reviews the Pull Requests and checks for consistency amongst various checkmarks.
- **Time**: Establish a maximum time for review completion to avoid bottlenecks (48 hours).

## 4. Review Process
- **Commenting**: Reviewers comment on lines of code where they see issues or have questions.
- **Discussion**: Encourage discussion within the PR to clarify intentions and suggest improvements.

## 5. Developer Response
- **Revisions**: The developer addresses each comment, making revisions as needed.
- **Re-Submission**: If significant changes are made, the code is reviewed again.

## 6. Final Decision
- **Approval**: If the reviewers are satisfied, they formally approve the PR.
- **Rejection**: If the code does not meet standards, the reviewers reject the PR with a clear explanation and suggestions for improvement.

## 7. Merge
- **Merge**: Once approved, the PR is merged into the main branch by the designated team member or lead.

## 8. Reflection
- **Meetings**: During scrum meetings, discussions on the code review process are conducted, and several important decisions are taken to refine and improve the process.
