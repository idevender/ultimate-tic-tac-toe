# Project Part 2/Sprint 1 Evaluation credit, CS2005 W2024

## Team submission

Team submission evaluation will be based on the following:

* The README file in your repo will be read by the marker to run the program, unit tests, and find out what other documentation the evaluator should read. It is your responsibility to tell the marker how to find the evaluation components, it is not the marker's responsibility to hunt through the documents and code to find those items.
  * The content of the Kanban Board, issue tracker, and repo will be reviewed
  * Other documents should be put in a documents folder in your repo and indicated in README file, if they should be read for marking assessment
  * If you are using other github tools that need to be reviewed (e.g. discussion or wiki tools) make sure this is made clear to the evaluator in the repo README file.

* Evaluation components will include:
  * Properly minuted SCRUM meetings and decisions (30%)
    * This will be weighted by the number of properly conducted meetings held on regular basis and quickly available in the repo.
    * **5 points** agenda coverage for each meeting includes progress review with kanban and issue tracker
    * **5 points** includes progress on agenda items suggested by prof on class webpage
    * **5 points** decisions documented properly with response plan and reflected in the Kanban Board/issue tracker
    * **5 points** changes to architecture and low level designs (interfaces) discussed, determined, and documented. Architecture documents adjusted accordingly.
    * **4 points** SCRUM master and notetaker roles rotated among team
    * **3 points** Minutes committed and pushed regularly, so team members can access.
    * **3 points** Features broken into tasks. Design interface/services and Coding tasks assigned to individual team members. Tasks on KanBan board.
  * Maintenance of the Kanban Board and the issue tracker in your project repository (15%)
    * Kanban board must be set up early in the first sprint. 
    * **2 points** Consistent continuous use. Assignment, labels, color coding, categories, etc. used appropriately and consistently by team. 
    * **5 points** Create cards for backlog features, required functionality for sprint 1, and assigned tasks.
    * **3 points** Progress of tasks/issues noted on board and tracker
    * **5 points** New issues (tasks) arising in meetings, reviews and otherwise are noted on issue tracker (board)
  * Performance reviews (how did the team members perform) conducted and documented (10%)
    * **5 points** Each team member assessed, by each other team member.
    * **5 points** Serious performance reviews including problems/personality clashes and possible solutions. A trivial review indicating everyone did fine will be assumed to be pro-forma and will be given no credibility.
    * **5 points** Problems with the team progress, dynamics and process must be identified and documented, and tracked with possible responses and progress on those items becoming kanban/agenda items. If you have no issues with a particular team member, you can at least make a suggestion for their project activity.
  * Code reviews conducted and documented. (20 %)
    * Code should be regularly presented and discussed at SCRUM meetings, not just at end of cycle.
    * **5 points** Code review details incorporated into process model and pull requests.
    * **3 points** Code contributions are presented to entire team.
    * **10 points** Code reviews are thorough, covering style issues (SOLID, de-coupling) as well as correctness. 
    * **5 points** All code should be reviewed by entire team before pull request is merged.
    * **2 points** Pull request deadlines for code contributions established and enforced.
  * Component Architecture Documents (15 %)
    * These should be updated as your project design matures during the sprint
      * **5 points** Details of components and interfaces documented
      * **5 points** Use of diagramming and prose to concisely offer complete details
      * **5 points** Consistent with modules, interfaces, docstring and unit tests
  * Process Model Document (10 %)
    * **5 points** Elements of process identifed and explained. Distinction made between process and process model.
    * **5 points** Changes in process since beginning of project are identified.
   * Sprint (end) release status (5%)
    * **5 points** operation of software and available features clear from documents and video/user manual

**100 points** total

## Individual Assignment

* Grade is based on the tasks assigned by the team

* Effort and Participation (33%)
  * **2 points** Task assignments are clear from team minutes 
  * **5 points** Task assignments are commensurate (equal) with other member's task assignments.
    * Note that this may lead to scaling of your entire grade for this submission
  * **3 points** Tasks are assigned in cards on kanban board
  * **5 points** Participation in code review presentations to team ensure team understands interface and code and receive feedback
  * **5 points** Issues and difficulties completing tasks are reported through team meetings, issue tracker
  * **10 points** Code production and time spent shows a serious effort undertaken
  * **3 points** Participation as SCRUM master and note-taker
* Process (25%)
  * **5 points** Kanban board, issue tracker used to track progress
  * **5 points** Regular reports of task progress appear throughout the sprint
  * **5 points** Code reviews of your submissions by team members is meaningful and leads to new kanban card, issue tracker items where appropriate
  * **5 points** Performance review of individual conducted by team members.
  * **5 points** Each assigned task must be made as a branch/pull request using team approved methodology.
  * You must meet the team imposed sprint pull-request deadline.
* Product (42%)
  * **2 points** Repository team README file includes where to find your design components and code, how to run your unit tests, and how to exercise your code within the current main/master branch project codebase.
    * Other documentation you want the marker to consider for individual assessment must be indicated in the project README file
  * **8 points** Architecture design documents indicates how your interface design and code fits into the overall project components. 
    * Architectural details of your component interface are detailed in UML and described in architecture documents.
  * **10 points** Unit tests are correct and working (not necessarily passing) for public interface methods/services of your design components and coding tasks, sufficient to test a correct mode and incorrect mode for different method invocations.
  * **5 points** Docstrings are complete and appropriate for all modules and public interface elements of your design components and coding tasks
  * **2 points** Stub implementations were/are completed where needed to support prototyping of your public interface methods. Lack of stubs must not delay other members' tasks.
  * **5 points** Status of tasks at end of sprint is clearly documented
  * **5 points** Code component shows consideration of dependency, SOLID, de-coupling, common patterns (Adapter) and other code style and standards applied as appropriate.
  * **5 points** Task completion with finished working code and attributions table

**100 points** total
