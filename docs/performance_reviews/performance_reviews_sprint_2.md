| Jager |Trying to understand everyones modules shows a drive for deeper understanding and commitment to the team however,  Devender could on work on taking more time to listen and understand the design decisions made by the team and to only be concerned about the new implementations that are relevant to his module to avoid wasting meeting time on repeated clarification and/or discussion on implementations that aren't relevant to him.  |

| Jager | Ali shows great understanding of his module, inter-module architecture, and required tasks but could take more of an initiative to aid team members in solving their problems and/or helping them understand the design decisions made by the team.  |

| Jager | Evan could try to play a more proactive and engaging role in team discussions and problem solving. Lacks initiative but delivers on tasks assigned. |

## Cameron's Performance review

| Jager | Cameron has a tendency to procrastinate, and could work on more swiftly submitting PR's, always delivers to the team's deadlines but tackling the problems sooner could result in issues being identified before team meetings.  |
