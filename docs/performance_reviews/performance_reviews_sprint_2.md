## Devender's Performance review

| Reviewer | Comments |
| -------- |----------|
| Cameron | Devender is an amazing caring person, he does need to work on his communication sometimes as he can get flustered and worried and then it is hard to get a word in.  |
| Ali | Devender is a smart individual. He does need to work on controlling himself to not speak over other team members when they're speaking during team meetings and hold is composure. |
| Jager |Trying to understand everyones modules shows a drive for deeper understanding and commitment to the team however,  Devender could on work on taking more time to listen and understand the design decisions made by the team and to only be concerned about the new implementations that are relevant to his module to avoid wasting meeting time on repeated clarification and/or discussion on implementations that aren't relevant to him.  |

## Ali's Performance review

| Reviewer | Comments |
| -------- |----------|
| Cameron | Ali is very intelligent and tries his best. Ali might take on more work than he needs to and it might not hurt to ask for help with some of the weight.  |
| Jager | Ali shows great understanding of his module, inter-module architecture, and required tasks but could take more of an initiative to aid team members in solving their problems and/or helping them understand the design decisions made by the team.  |

## Evan's Performance review

| Reviewer | Comments |
| -------- |----------|
| Cameron | Evan is quiet, but that's okay because he's not talking over anyone, but sometimes I think it wouldn't hurt if he did. He is polite. |
| Ali | Evan has the potential to enhance his participation in team discussions and decisions by taking more initiatives. |
| Devender |                                                    |
| Jager | Evan could try to play a more proactive and engaging role in team discussions and problem solving. Lacks initiative but delivers on tasks assigned. |

## Cameron's Performance review

| Reviewer | Comments |
| -------- | -------- |
| Jager | Cameron has a tendency to procrastinate, and could work on more swiftly submitting PR's, always delivers to the team's deadlines but tackling the problems sooner could result in issues being identified before team meetings.  |
| Ali | Cameron consistently meets team deadlines and delivers work reliably. However, he could further enhance his productivity by tackling issues sooner and thereby identifying any potential future problems. |
| Devender |  |
