## Jager Cooper's Performance review

| Reviewer | Comments |
| -------- |----------|
| Cameron | Jager is a good leader, he can get a lot done very quickly, sometimes maybe a little too quickly. |
| Ali | Jager is an amazing team player, he is willing to go the extra mile for the team. |
| Devender | Jager's swift problem-solving and leadership capabilties have been pivotal, driving the team towards key milestones efficiently. His rapid pace is an asset, though increased communication on changes would ensure the entire team remains synchronized, enhancing our collaborative efforts                                                                                          |
| Evan |  Jager was amazing to work with, he put in work to understand all levels of the project architecture, and helped anyone whenever they needed it. He put a lot of time into making sure that we had a working product, and that we set clear goals in each meeting. The only suggestion would be to give details about changes to all team members, so they can adjust their module for better interactivity. |

| -------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cameron | Devender is an amazing caring person, he does need to work on his communication sometimes as he can get flustered and worried and then it is hard to get a word in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Ali | Devender is a smart individual. He does need to work on controlling himself to not speak over other team members when they're speaking during team meetings and hold is composure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Jager | Trying to understand everyones modules shows a drive for deeper understanding and commitment to the team however,  Devender could on work on taking more time to listen and understand the design decisions made by the team and to only be concerned about the new implementations that are relevant to his module to avoid wasting meeting time on repeated clarification and/or discussion on implementations that aren't relevant to him. |
| Evan | Devender was committed to doing his absolute best on this project. He was great to work with, and always was wanting to understand any changes made to any module. Although he can get a bit overwhelmed sometimes with incoming due dates, this drives him to succeed.                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Ali's Performance review

| Reviewer | Comments |
| -------- |----------|
| Cameron | Ali is very intelligent and tries his best. Ali might take on more work than he needs to and it might not hurt to ask for help with some of the weight.  |
| Jager | Ali shows great understanding of his module, inter-module architecture, and required tasks but could take more of an initiative to aid team members in solving their problems and/or helping them understand the design decisions made by the team. |
| Devender | Ali is really good at frontend and is happy to do a lot of work. He needs to share more about what he does, so other people can help him and know what he is doing.                 |
| Evan |  Ali was a pleasure to work with. He did a great job working with the frontend, he did great when being scrum master, and got everyone to always stay on task. He could work on communicating changes made on his part with all members of the team, for their better understanding of his module. |

## Evan's Performance review

| Reviewer | Comments |
| -------- |----------|
| Cameron | Evan is quiet, but that's okay because he's not talking over anyone, but sometimes I think it wouldn't hurt if he did. He is polite. |
| Ali | Evan has the potential to enhance his participation in team discussions and decisions by taking more initiatives. |
| Devender | Evan is known for his attention to detail and kindness, which help foster a calm environment. However, he has the potential to be more involved in conversations and tackle tasks independently in order to improve teamwork and group interactions.                                                 |
| Jager | Evan could try to play a more proactive and engaging role in team discussions and problem solving. Lacks initiative but delivers on tasks assigned. |

## Cameron's Performance review

| Reviewer | Comments |
| -------- | -------- |
| Jager | Cameron has a tendency to procrastinate, and could work on more swiftly submitting PR's, always delivers to the team's deadlines but tackling the problems sooner could result in issues being identified before team meetings. |
| Ali | Cameron consistently meets team deadlines and delivers work reliably. However, he could further enhance his productivity by tackling issues sooner and thereby identifying any potential future problems. |
| Devender | Cameron finishes his work on time. He needs to plan ahead to have time to make things better and fix problems before they happen.                      |
| Evan | Cameron was an asset to the team. He did great with his portion of the project. Although he sometimes can be busy, he wasn't afraid to ask for some help, and it resulted in better understanding of his module from my end, which allowed me to make better decisions about my own module. |
