| -------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cameron | Needs to slow down on implementation so that others have a chance to plan their own design.                                                                                                                                         |
| Ali | Cooper could focus more on designs and implementation choices before producing code to better syncronize between other members' designs and implementations |
| Devender |  Shows strong individual performance; encouraged to seek more opportunities for team collaboration to leverage collective strengths.                         |
| Evan | Attended all meetings and communicated changes with the team effectively. Could work on keeping the task board up to date with issues. Helped teammates where they needed it and consistently worked on his portion of the project. |

| -------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cameron | Needs to be more confident in his decision making.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Ali | Devender cound work more on his stress management and try not to overstress about project submission and other course related activites. |
| Jager | When Devender is Scrum master he could be more aggressive in terms of taking control of the meeting and keeping us on task.                                                                        |
| Evan | Devender attended and participated in all meetings. Could work on communicating changes for better interactivity between each module. Kept issues up to date and had consistent progress on tasks. |

| -------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cameron | Needs to be ontop of the pull-requests.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Jager | There's room for improvement in your time management skills to ensure timely delivery of tasks.                                                                                                       |
| Devender | Attended all the meetings and team reviews. Does good work, but has to faster on accepting PRs and reviewing tasks.                                                                                   |
| Evan | Ali Attended all meetings and was very punctual. Could work on communicating changes to all members of the group. Kept task board and issues up to date, and was very responsive when reviewing PR's. |

| -------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cameron | Needs to put foot forward to show how much work he has done and helped with.                                              |
| Ali | Evan could work on his communication and involve himself in the team meetings to better his productivity |
