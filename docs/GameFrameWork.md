# Game Framework Proposal

The Game Framework Proposal outlines the architectural redesign and refactoring of modules within our game development project. This proposal encompasses the essential changes required to enhance the overall functionality, performance, and maintainability of our game development framework.

The proposed framework redesign involves restructuring modules, updating interfaces, and incorporating architectural diagrams to illustrate these changes effectively. By refactoring the existing modules and comparing the redesign to the current architecture, we aim to achieve a more efficient and scalable game development environment.

Additionally, the framework proposal provides clear instructions on how to use the redesigned framework, emphasizing the decoupling of modules to address integration issues and improve overall development workflow. Through this proposal, we aim to streamline the game development process and enhance the user experience of our games.

## Refactoring Modules

The Refactoring Modules section of our project focuses on the detailed analysis and restructuring of specific modules within our game development framework. This involves identifying areas for improvement, updating interfaces, and making architectural changes to enhance the functionality and maintainability of these modules.

Each module will undergo a thorough evaluation to identify any inefficiencies, inconsistencies, or outdated design patterns. The refactoring process aims to address these issues by implementing best practices, optimizing code structures, and improving overall performance.

Furthermore, this section will include architectural diagrams and explanations of interface changes to illustrate the redesigned modules effectively. By refactoring these modules, we aim to enhance code readability, reduce technical debt, and improve the overall quality of our game development framework.
