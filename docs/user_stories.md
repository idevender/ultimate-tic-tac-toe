# User Stories

## Story 1: First time player

### Written by: Jager Cooper

**As a** newcomer to the world of Tic Tac Toe and Ultimate Tic Tac Toe,  
**I want** a clear tutorial or rulebook integrated into the game,  
**So that** I can understand the game's objective and mechanics effortlessly.

### Description

Joe is a first-time user who has never encountered Tic Tac Toe or Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. Intrigued by a friend's recommendation, Joe visits the game website, creates an account, and eagerly logs in to explore this new gaming experience. Upon entering the game lobby, Joe selects the first available opponent and starts a game. However, Joe quickly realizes that he lacks a fundamental understanding of the game's objective and rules. Frustrated by the lack of guidance, Joe exits the game without completing it.

#### Feature Suggestion

Incorporate an interactive tutorial or rulebook directly within the game interface to assist new players like Joe in learning the game's mechanics and objectives. The tutorial should provide step-by-step instructions, visual aids, and explanations of key concepts to ensure a smooth onboarding experience for beginners.

#### Design Suggestions

- Include tooltips or pop-up hints during gameplay to remind players of the current objective or suggest optimal moves.
- Implement a practice mode where players can play against AI opponents or explore different strategies without the pressure of a competitive match.
  
### Acceptance Criteria

1. A totally new player to the games of tic tac toe and/or ultimate tic tac toe, should have a clear understanding of how to play the game.
2. The tutorial should be accessible from the user's dashboard or main game page with clear navigation instructions.
3. The tutorial content should cover basic gameplay mechanics, such as how to place marks on the board, win conditions, and turn-taking rules.
4. New players should be able to refer back to the tutorial at any point during their gameplay session for quick reminders or clarifications.

### Tasks

- **App Logic Module:** define a clear set of rules, regulations and objectives in a tutorial text to be stored in a string/list to send to Server on request.
- **Server API Module:** request the tutorial from app logic and pass to the front-end to be displayed as an element in the UI.
- **Front-End Module:** Create a UI element that takes a tutorial as a parameter and displays it on the user's dashboard and/or on the main game page during an active game.

### Additional Information

- **Dependency:** Ensure that the tutorial content is written in a clear and understandable manner, catering to users with no prior knowledge of tic tac toe or ultimate tic tac toe.
- **Constraints:** The tutorial should be concise yet comprehensive, covering all essential rules, regulations, and objectives of both tic tac toe and ultimate tic tac toe games.
- **Reference:** Refer to existing game rulebooks or tutorials for inspiration and accuracy in content creation.
- **User Feedback:** Gather feedback from new players to assess the effectiveness and clarity of the tutorial in helping them understand the game objectives.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Plan for iterative updates to the tutorial based on user feedback and any future rule changes or additions to the games.
- **Localization:** Consider the possibility of translating the tutorial into multiple languages to cater to a wider audience of new players.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that the tutorial is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following accessibility guidelines for UI elements and content presentation.
