Web-Based Project Development Process Model Document

Project Name:  TEAM G - Web-Based Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

Team:  Cameron Selci, Jager Cooper, Evan Best, Mohd Ali Bin Naser, Devender Singh

Course:  COMP 2005 - Software Engineering

Date: March 16th, 2023

Overview

This document outlines the process model to be followed by the team G of COMP 2005 (Winter 2024)The process model integrates Agile principles with Git/GitHub for efficient collaboration and iterative development.

Process Description

The development process follows Agile principles, emphasizing iterative development, frequent communication, and continuous improvement. The process consists of the following phases:

Sprint Planning

Duration: 2.5 weeks per sprint
The team conducts sprint planning meetings to select user stories from the product backlog.
Tasks are defined, estimated, and assigned to team members.
Sprint goals and priorities are established.

Sprint Execution
Development tasks are carried out according to the sprint plan.
Each team member works on their assigned tasks, collaborating as needed.
Daily stand-up meetings are held to discuss progress, challenges, and plans for the day.

Sprint Review
At the end of each sprint, the team conducts a sprint review meeting.

Sprint Retrospective
The team holds a sprint retrospective meeting to reflect on the sprint.
Successes, challenges, and areas for improvement are discussed.
Action items are identified to enhance future sprints.

Roles and Responsibilities

Product Owner: Responsible for maintaining the product backlog, prioritizing user stories, and providing direction for the project.
Scrum Master: Facilitates the Agile process, organizes meetings, and removes impediments to the team's progress.
Development Team: Consists of 5 college students responsible for designing, developing, testing, and deploying the web-based project.

Artifacts and Deliverables

Product Backlog: Contains a list of user stories, features, and enhancements prioritized by the product owner.
Sprint Backlog: Subset of items selected from the product backlog for implementation during the current sprint.
Working Software Increment: Deliverable at the end of each sprint, showcasing completed features and functionality.

Tools and Resources

Git/GitHub: Version control system used for collaboration, code management, and tracking changes.
Agile Project Management Tool: Github Projects Kanban Board, Issue Tracker
Development Tools Environment: VsCode, Python, Bottle, HTML, CSS, Unittest, Shelve

Quality Assurance and Testing

Continuous testing throughout the sprint, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
Test cases are created based on todo tasks in the kanban board and acceptance criteria.
Bugs and issues are tracked and resolved using GitHub issue tracking system.

Change Management

Changes to requirements are accommodated through ongoing collaboration with the product owner.
Changes are evaluated based on their impact on the current sprint and prioritized accordingly.

Risk Management

In our case, risks are the coding issues that are identified and discussed during sprint planning and retrospectives.
Mitigation strategies are implemented to address potential risks and issues that may arise during development.

Schedule and Milestones

Bi-weekly sprints with fixed durations of 2 weeks each.
Milestones include the completion of sprint goals and delivery of working software increments at the end of each sprint.
