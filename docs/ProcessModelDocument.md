# Web-Based Project Development Process Model Document

#### Project Name:  TEAM G - Web-Based Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

#### Team:  Cameron Selci, Jager Cooper, Evan Best, Mohd Ali Bin Naser, Devender Singh

#### Course:  COMP 2005 - Software Engineering

#### Sprint 1 Deadline: March 16th, 2024

#### Sprint 2 Deadline: April 5th, 2024

### 1. Overview

Team G's Web-based Ultimate Tic Tac Toe a platform for 2 players to play Ultimate Tic Tac Toe against eachother on their respective browser windows. This document outlines the software process model to be followed for the development of the Online Bookstore Management System. This document outlines the process model to be followed by the team G of COMP 2005 (Winter 2024)The process model integrates Agile principles with Git/GitHub for efficient collaboration and iterative development.

### 2. Objectives

The objectives of this software process model are:
- To develop a user-friendly and efficient Web-based Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.
- To ensure timely delivery of high-quality software.
- To establish clear communication channels among team members, professor, and the marker.
- To adhere to budget and resource constraints.
- To accommodate changes in requirements effectively.

### 3. Process Model Description

The software development process will follow the Agile methodology, specifically Scrum. The Scrum process model emphasizes iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability. The development process will consist of the following phases:

- **Product Backlog Refinement:** The product backlog will be continuously refined, and user stories will be prioritized based on business value.
- **Sprint Planning:** At the beginning of each sprint, the development team will select user stories from the product backlog and commit to completing them within the sprint duration. The duration of each sprint will be approximately 2.5 weeks.
- **Sprint Execution:** During the sprint, development tasks will be carried out according to the sprint plan. Daily stand-up meetings will be conducted to monitor progress and address any issues.
- **Sprint Review:** At the end of each sprint, a review meeting will be held to demonstrate the completed functionality to stakeholders and gather feedback.
- **Sprint Retrospective:** Following the sprint review, a retrospective meeting will be conducted to reflect on the sprint process and identify areas for improvement.

### 4. Roles and Responsibilities

The following roles and responsibilities are defined for the software development process:
- **Professor:** Responsible for maintaining the product backlog, prioritizing user stories, and providing direction for the project.
- **Scrum Master:** Responsible for facilitating the Scrum process, removing impediments, and ensuring adherence to Scrum principles.
- **Development Team:** Consists of 5 college students responsible for designing, developing, testing, and deploying the web-based project.
- **Stakeholders:** Responsible for providing feedback, reviewing deliverables, and approving changes.

### 5. Artifacts and Deliverables

The following deliverables will be produced during each sprint of the software development process:
- **User Stories:** Defined and prioritized in the product backlog.
- **Working Software Increment:** Functional features implemented according to user requirements, deliverable at the end of each sprint, showcasing completed features and functionality.
- **Sprint Retrospective Report:** Insights and action items identified during the sprint retrospective for process improvement.
- **Product Backlog**: Contains a list of user stories, features, and enhancements prioritized by the professor.
- **Sprint Backlog**: Subset of items selected from the product backlog for implementation during the current sprint.

### 6. Tools and Resources

Git/GitHub: Version control system used for collaboration, code management, and tracking changes.
Agile Project Management Tool: Github Projects Kanban Board, Issue Tracker
Development Tools Environment: VsCode, Python, Bottle, HTML, CSS, Unittest, Shelve

### 7. Quality Assurance and Testing

Continuous testing throughout the sprint, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
Test cases are created based on todo tasks in the kanban board and acceptance criteria.
Bugs and issues are tracked and resolved using GitHub issue tracking system.

### 8. Risk Management

In our case, risks are the coding issues that are identified and discussed during sprint planning and retrospectives.
Issues that are identified during team meetings or individually are assigned & addressed using Github's issue tracker.
Mitigation strategies are implemented to address potential risks and issues that may arise during development.


### 9. Conclusion:

This software process model document establishes the framework for managing the development of the Web-based Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Game from Team G. By following the Agile Scrum methodology, we aim to deliver a high-quality product that meets the needs of our users while accommodating changes in requirements effectively.
